                <h4>Olivia Newton-John</h4>
                <p>I'm saying all the things that I know you'll like<br/>
                Making good conversation<br/>
                I gotta handle you just right<br/>
                You know what I mean<br/>
                I took you to an intimate restaurant<br/>
                Then to a suggestive movie<br/>
                There's nothing left to talk about<br/>
                Unless it's horizontally</p>

                <p>Let's get physical, physical<br/>
                I want to get physical<br/>
                Let's get into physical<br/>
                Let me hear your body talk, your body talk<br/>
                Let me hear your body talk</p>

                <p>I've been patient, I've been good<br/>
                Tried to keep my hands on the table<br/>
                It's gettin' hard this holdin' back<br/>
                If you know what I mean</p>

                <p>I'm sure you'll understand my point of view<br/>
                We know each other mentally<br/>
                You gotta know that you're bringin' out<br/>
                The animal in me</p>

                <p>Let's get physical, physical<br/>
                I want to get physical<br/>
                Let's get into physical<br/>
                Let me hear your body talk, your body talk<br/>
                Let me hear your body talk</p>

                <p>Let's get physical, physical<br/>
                I want to get physical<br/>
                Let's get into physical<br/>
                Let me hear your body talk, your body talk<br/>
                Let me hear your body talk</p>

                <p>Let's get animal, animal<br/>
                I want to get animal<br/>
                Let's get into animal<br/>
                Let me hear your body talk<br/>
